<subtext><p>This exercise will cover XML and JSON well-formedness. </p></subtext>
<text><p>We recommend you use an online editor to validate and check your solutions for well-formedness, such as <link style="underline">this</link> for XML and this for JSON. To edit XML files, something like this might work better, which offers syntax highlighting and formatting.
If you prefer, you can instead install oXygen, an XML/JSON development IDE. You should have received a license key for it by email.</p></text>

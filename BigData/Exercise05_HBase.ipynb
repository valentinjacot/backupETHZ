But, these clusters burn Azure credit very quickly&mdash;the cheapest configuration consumes roughly **2 CHF per hour**, which is a lot relative to your overall credit&mdash;so it is very important for you to **delete your cluster once you are done.** Luckily, it is possible to keep your data intact when you delete a cluster, and see it again when you recreate it; we will touch upon this in the process. Now, let's start. Those steps are very similar to the HDFS cluster we create on week 3.\n",

This has a significant advantage of allowing you to delete your HBase cluster without losing the data: you can recreate the cluster using the same Azure Storage Account and the same container and you will see the same data. This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot). In \"Select a Storage Account\" click \"Create new\" and specify a name. **Important: if you are recreating your HBase cluster and want to see the existing data, then choose \"Select existing\" and set the container name to the one that you see in the \"Storage Accounts\" tab of Azure&mdash;by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container.** Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".\n",

                "1. Now we need to choose the configuration of the nodes in our HBase cluster. It will be enough to have **only 2 RegionServers**(see the screenshot). As for the node size, let us be wise and select the economical option: click on \"Region node size\" and choose \"D3 V2\"; do the same for the Head nodes; the \"Zookeeper\" nodes should have \"A4 v2\" selected by default (Zookeeper is a [distributed coordination service](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) used by HBase).

These clusters are expensive, so it is worth checking the price estimate at this step: for me it is 1.96 CHF/hour; if your price is larger than this, check your node sizes and counts. When done, initiate the cluster creation by clicking \"Create\". The process will take time, around 15&mdash;25 minutes."

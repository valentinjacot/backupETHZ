REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of *stateless* operations. \n\nThe most popular operations in REST are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. A response may be in XML, HTML, JSON, or some other format.\n\nIn this exercise we will use REST online client [ReqBin](https://reqbin.com/). \n \n**URLs** tells the server which resources the client wants to interact with.\n\nThe **method** request tells the server what kind of action the client wants the server to take in.  \n \n**Headers** provide meta-information about a request.\n \nThe request **body** contains the data the client wants to send the server.\n\n\n### Task 1.\n1. Use ReqBin to list all blobs in your container. For this use the following [REST request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs). What does it do? To avoid setting up an authentication you can make your container public.  \n    1. Access your container from all resources > your storage account > \"Blobs\" in the overview tab > your container name\n    2. On the top menu of the tab \"Change access level\" and set for public access level \"Container\"\n2. What is the response format of the request? \n3. Try to perform the following REST requests [Get Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob), [Get Blob Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-properties), [Get Blob Metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-metadata) using ReqBin.\n\n"

In HDFS, each block of the file is either 64 or 128 megabytes depending on the version and distribution of Hadoop in use, and this cannot be changed.\n\n1. A client wanting to write a file into HDFS, first contacts the NameNode, then sends the data to it. The NameNode will write the data into multiple DataNodes in a pipelined fashion. \n\n1. A DataNode may execute multiple application tasks for different clients concurrently.\n\n1. The cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients per cluster.\n\n1. HDFS NameNodes keep the namespace in RAM.\n\n1. The locations of block replicas are part of the persistent checkpoint that the NameNode stores in its native file system. <font color='blue'>(more detail in [1])</font>\n\n1. If the block size is set to 64 megabytes, storing a file of 80 megabytes will actually require 128 megabytes of physical memory (2 blocks of 64 megabytes each). \n\n\n### 1.2 &ndash; Where is the information stored?

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarise you with shell commands and the operations to administer an HDFS deployment.\n\n### 4.1 &ndash; Do the following to set up an HDFS cluster:\n\n**Important:** we want you to use a small but real cluster for running HDFS rather than a single machine. But, these clusters burn Azure credit very quickly&mdash;the cheapest configuration consumes roughly **2 CHF per hour**, which is a lot relative to your overall credit&mdash;so it is very important for you to _<font color='red'>**delete**</font>_ your cluster once you are done. Luckily, _it is possible to keep your data intact when you delete a cluster_, and see it again when you recreate it; we will touch upon this in the process. Now, let's start ...\n\n\n1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click on the \"+ Create a Resource\" button on the left. Type \"hdinsight\" in the search box, and select \"HDInsight\". HDInsight is Microsoft's cloud service which wraps Hadoop, HBase, Spark and other Big Data technologies; read more [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/).\n![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/exercise04assets/Azure_HBase_1.png)\n1. Switch to the \"Custom\" mode (see the screenshot), fill in the form with cluster name, user names and passwords, and select \"Hadoop\" as the cluster type. Create a new resource group, e.g., \"exercise03\". Click \"Next\".\n![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2018/exercise03assets/Azure_HDFS_2.png)\n1. In the next we need to configure the location to store all the cluster data. The canonical storage layer for an HDFS cluster uses the Blob service of Windows Azure Storage and the primary advantage is that it allows you to delete your HDFS cluster without losing the stored data: you can recreate the cluster using the same Azure Storage Account and the same container and you will see the same data. This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot). In \"Select a Storage Account\" click \"Create new\" and specify a name. **Important: if you are recreating your HDFS cluster and want to see the existing data, then choose \"Select existing\" and set the container name to the one that you see in the \"Storage Accounts\" tab of Azure&mdash;by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container.** Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".\n![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/exercise04assets/Azure_HBase_3.png)\n1. In the \"Applications\" step do not choose anything and just click \"Next\". We will be using HDFS directly.\n1. Now we need to choose the configuration of the nodes in our HDFS cluster. Nodes in HDIsight have similar names yet types, compared with the concepts of HDFS you have learned from the lecture. In this exercise, you will see _head node (aka namenode) and worker node (aka datanode)_. To read more, this blog on [\"Nodes in HDInsight\"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuredatalake/2017/03/10/nodes-in-hdinsight/) is helpful. It will be enough to have only 2 **worker** nodes (see the screenshot). As for the node size, let us be wise and select the economical option: click on \"Worker node size\", click \"View all\" (see the screenshot), and choose \"**A3**\"; do the same for the **Head** nodes. Click \"Next\".\n![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_creation.png)\n1. All the fields on the \"Advanced settings\" step can be left as they are. Simply proceed by clicking \"Next\".\n1. In the last step, \"Summary\", check if the settings are as you intend. These clusters are expensive, so it is worth checking the price estimate at this step: for me it is 1.20 CHF/hour; if your price is larger than this, check your node sizes and counts. When done, initiate the cluster creation by clicking \"Create\". The process will take time, around 15&mdash;25 minutes; in my own case it took 20 minutes."

      "source": "### 4.2 &ndash; Accessing your cluster\nThe standard way to interact with an HDFS cluster is via the Java API or a command-line interface. We will use the latter and for this, you will need to run the `ssh` program in a terminal in order to connect to your cluster. There are three options of how you can do this:\n1. **On your own machine** you can just use a normal terminal if you have `ssh` installed. Linux usually has it, as does MacOS. Windows doesn't have it by default (powershell on Win10 does, though), but Windows users can use one of the browser-based options, which are described next, and the other option is to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).\n1. **In your browser, two possibilities:**\n  1. Use the **Azure Cloud Shell**. Click on the Cloud Shell icon at the top of Azure Dashboard toolbar:\n  ![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/exercise04assets/Azure_HBase_5.png)\n  Choose \"bash\". It will request your approval for creating a Storage Account required for the shell; choose the corresponding subscription and you can also create a new storage account or use an old storage account.\n  1. Use the built-in **terminal on Jupyter**. In your [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com), find the terminal button on the right side, click on it. \n  ![](https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_terminal.png)\n\nIn your terminal of choice, run the following (this command with everything filled-in is also available on the Azure page of your HDFS cluster, if you click \"SSH + Cluster login\" and select the host name): \n<img src=\"https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_ssh.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n<br>\n`ssh <ssh_user_name>@<cluster_name>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net`\n\nIn this command, `<ssh_user_name>` is the \"ssh username\" that you have chosen in the first step of creating the HDFS cluster, and `<cluster_name>` also comes from that form. Note that the cluster name has to be suffixed with `-ssh`. \n\n\nIf after running the `ssh` command you see a message similar to this:\n```\nWelcome to HDInsight.\n\nLast login: Sun Mar 10 15:56:49 2019 from 23.97.160.50\nTo run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\n<ssh_user_name>@hn0-cluster:~$\n```\nthen you have successfully connected to your HDFS cluster. Now proceed to the next task."

The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs ([source](https://ambari.apache.org/)).\n\nWe utilize this monitoring dashboard to inspect the behaviors of our HDFS cluster. You will see prominent behavior changes (e.g., resource usage live for the nodes and network usage going up) esp. when uploading some new data. \n\nClick into the Ambari home. You can explore the following: \n1. An overview of the cluster (namenode, datanode)\n    - One namenode is active, the other one is standby\n<img src=\"https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_monitor_overview.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n    \n2. Space utilization on HDFS and the node details (2 namenodes, 2 datanodes, 3 zookeeper nodes)\n    - The \"Zookeeper\" nodes are selected by default (Zookeeper is a [distributed coordination service](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) used by HDFS). By default, HDInsight provides 3 Zookeeper nodes. \n    - You can click on each box to see the operating details of each node.\n<img src=\"https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_monitor_nodes.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n    \n3.

Replication factor\n    - You will find a \"under replication\" warning in the service monitoring. Why?\n    - HDFS is configured with a dfs.replication setting of 3. Thus, the blocks of the scratch files are under-replicated whenever there are fewer than three worker nodes online, because there are not the expected three copies of each file block available. ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-scaling-best-practices))\n    - Since we have chosen (for economical reason) 2 datanodes, the system then reports underreplication.\n\n<img src=\"https://ethbigdata2017.blob.core.windows.net/bigdataforengineers2019/ex03_hdfs_cluster_monitor_replication.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n    "

List the directories or files: ```ls```\n    - For a file ls returns statistics on the file: ```$hdfs dfs -ls /example/data/fruits.txt```\n    <br>This gives you the following:\n    ```-rw-r--r--   1 root supergroup         66 2019-03-10 15:45 /example/data/fruits.txt```\n    - For a directory it returns list of its direct children as in Unix: ```$ hdfs dfs -ls /example```\n    <br>This gives you the following:\n    ```Found 2 items\n    drwxr-xr-x   - root supergroup          0 2019-03-10 15:46 /example/data\n    drwxr-xr-x   - root supergroup          0 2019-03-10 15:46 /example/jars\n    ```\n    - List files in a directory: ```$ hdfs dfs -ls /example/data/*```\n    - List all the directories in your HDFS: ```$ hdfs dfs -ls -R /```\n<br><br>\n2. Copies source paths to stdout: ```cat```\n    - Inspect the file content (!DO NOT do it for a large file): ```$ hdfs dfs -cat /example/data/fruits.txt```\n<br><br>\n3. Copy files from source to destination: ```cp```\n    - ```$ hdfs dfs -cp /example/data/fruits.txt /example/data/fruits-copy.txt```\n<br><br>\n4. Delete files: ```rm```\n    - ```$ hdfs dfs -rm /example/data/fruits-copy.txt```<br>\n    This gives you:\n    ```19/03/10 16:57:11 INFO fs.TrashPolicyDefault: Moved: 'wasb://susiecluster-2019-03-10t15-05-38-179z@hdfsdata.blob.core.windows.net/example/data/fruits-copy.txt' to trash at: wasb://susiecluster-2019-03-10t15-05-38-179z@hdfsdata.blob.core.windows.net/user/sshuser/.Trash/Current/example/data/fruits-copy.txt```, the file is trashed. \n    - When you then check ```$ hdfs dfs -ls /example/data/fruits-copy.txt```,\n    you will see the file does not exist anymore by getting this message: \n    ```ls: '/example/data/fruits-copy.txt': No such file or directory```\n<br><br>\n\n6. Creates directories: ```mkdir```\n    - We create a folder for our exercise by ```$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /ex03```\n<br><br>\n\n7. Copy a file from the file system where your terminal locates to HDFS: ```copyFromLocal```\n    - First we create a file on the file system where your terminal locates (can be local or on a cluster):\n    ```\n    $ echo \"we create a file on the cluster(hn0) file system\" > cluster.txt\n    $ cat cluster.txt\n    ```\n    - These two commands are equivalent:\n    ```\n    $ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal -f local.txt /ex03/\n    $ hdfs dfs -put -f cluster.txt /ex03/\n    ```\n    - The -f option will overwrite the destination if it already exists.\n<br><br>\n8. The reverse operation of ```copyFromLocal```, i.e., download a file from HDFS to the file system where your terminal locates: ```copyToLocal```\n\n    - ```$ hdfs dfs -copyToLocal /example/data/fruits.txt```\n    - If you do ```$ ls``` in your terminal, you should see the \"fruits\" file there.\n<br><br>    \n\n9. Delete a directory: ```rmdir```\n    - We cannot delete a non-empty folder directly, so we need to remove the files inside by ```$ hdfs dfs -rm /ex03/*```\n    - We then remove the folder ```$ hdfs dfs -rmdir /ex03```\n    - If you do ls again on the deleted folder, it should not exist any more. ```$ hdfs dfs -ls /ex03```"

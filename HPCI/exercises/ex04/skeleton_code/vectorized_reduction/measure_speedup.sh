# Description: Measure vectorized speedup with multiple cores.  Once you have
#              completed your code, you can run this script with
#
#              make measurement
#
#              using the 'measurement' target in the Makefile.  It will
#              schedule a job on a compute node on euler.  See the Makefile.
